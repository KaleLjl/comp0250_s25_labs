# Active Context: COMP0250 Coursework 1 (CW1 Focus)

## Current Focus

*   **CW1 Robustness:** Improving the stability of the existing solution for CW1 Tasks 1 & 2, specifically addressing reported crashes during initialization.
*   **CW1 Task 3 Implementation:** Developing the perception and manipulation logic required to complete Task 3 (detecting colored boxes/baskets and sorting boxes into matching baskets).
*   **Memory Bank Update:** Reflecting the shift in focus solely to CW1.

## Recent Changes

*   **[Previous Session]** Initialized Memory Bank structure and populated core files based on CW1 & CW2 PDFs.
*   **[2025-04-07]** Received user instruction to focus solely on CW1 (robustness for Tasks 1&2, implementation of Task 3) and ignore CW2.
*   **[2025-04-07]** Read all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   **[2025-04-07]** Updated `projectbrief.md` to reflect CW1 focus.
*   **[2025-04-07]** Updated `productContext.md` to reflect CW1 focus.
*   **[2025-04-07]** Updating `activeContext.md` (this file).

## Next Steps

1.  Update `systemPatterns.md` to reflect CW1 focus.
2.  Update `techContext.md` to reflect CW1 focus.
3.  Update `progress.md` to reflect current status (CW1 focus, known robustness issue, Task 3 pending).
4.  Analyze potential causes for initialization crashes in CW1 Tasks 1 & 2.
5.  Develop and implement strategies to improve robustness.
6.  Begin planning and implementation for CW1 Task 3.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Scope Change:** Project scope is now limited to CW1. CW2 is deferred.
*   **Prioritization:** Robustness improvements for existing CW1 tasks (1 & 2) are a high priority alongside implementing Task 3.
*   **Debugging:** Need to investigate the root cause of initialization failures reported for Tasks 1 & 2.

## Learnings & Insights

*   **Robustness Issue:** The current CW1 solution (Tasks 1 & 2) suffers from intermittent crashes during initialization, indicating potential race conditions, timing issues, or unhandled exceptions in setup phases.
*   **CW1 Task 3 Complexity:** Task 3 requires integrating perception (detecting multiple boxes and baskets, identifying colors) with manipulation (planning and executing multiple pick-and-place actions based on perceived data).
*   [Previous insights regarding core technologies, language recommendations, package structure, evaluation criteria, and perception constraints remain valid for CW1].
